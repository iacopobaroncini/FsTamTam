     * Events
     * Lists (AI Waypoints, and Facility Airports, Waypoints, NDBs, VORs, TACANs)
     * Facility VORs
     * Facility TACANs
 - PMDG-NGX
     * Variables
     * Events
     * CDU data
     
For cockipt elements (devices):

     * Based on Arduino boards (USB connections)
     * C++ programs (raw TCP connections)
     * HTML5 (WebSocket connections)
